# iloc
This package provides demographics and maps of ABS Indigenous Locations (ILOCs) based on 2016 census data.
Downloading this package may (definitely will) take a while. This package includes compressed census data and shape files.

You can get the package up and running with the following code:<br/>
```
library(iloc)
map = iloc_find("Wollongong")
iloc_map(map)
```
